# React-Frontend-Application-Using-NASA-APIs---MERN-Stack
### In this assignment, I have been developed a creative frontend application using React functional components. The application will consume data from NASA's public APIs available at NASA API portal. This project aims to showcase my skills in front-end development, integration with external APIs, and application deployment.Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express. js, React, Node. js).

## Functional requirements
1. To develop a React application with a strong emphasis on functional components.
2. To integrate and utilize data effectively from NASA's APIs.
3. To enhance usability through a sophisticated CSS framework.
4. To manage user sessions effectively, with the option to develop a separate REST API for user 
management.
5. To maintain a robust version control system through regular git commits.
6. To deploy the application on a suitable hosting platform.
7. To perform comprehensive testing across the application.


## Setup project
1. Clone this project and install all the dependancies using the npm i or npm install command.
2. Create a config.env file in the root directory and specify PORT, MONGO_URI and JWT_TOKEN.
JWT_TOKEN - 50 char alpha numeric
PORT - 3000 (backend)
if changed PORT is not 3000, make appropriate changes to api request calls, in client files.
3. 
4. Start the project with npm start command. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
